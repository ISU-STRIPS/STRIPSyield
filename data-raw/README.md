This directory contains raw data and scripts to convert the raw data into R
data.frames saved in the ../data/ directory for inclusion in the R package.

Luis Damiano is currently the owner of this directory and its subdirectories.

## Data.frames

The data and scripts in this directory should construct the following 
data.frames:

- spatial_yield: yield data with as much spatial resolution as possible
- yield: watershed summaries of the yield

It may also need to create smaller data sets that provide a mechanism for 
converting yield measurements, e.g. yield_conversion.
